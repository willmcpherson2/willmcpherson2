### Projects

I have a blog at [willmcpherson2.com](http://willmcpherson2.com). The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/willmcpherson2/blog)

My current project is called [Tulip](https://github.com/willmcpherson2/tulip). It's a tiny, untyped, lazy, interpreted, pure programming language.

Tulip uses [Parss](https://github.com/willmcpherson2/parss), a parser combinator library tailored for [multi-pass, infallible and pure parsing](https://github.com/willmcpherson2/tulip/commit/14a2ae8a5fcfc1a6ed8ddad5bc8e21c23a94ab20).

All three projects are written in Haskell :-)

### Job

I currently work at RMIT's AI Innovation Lab.
