### Projects

I have a blog at [willmcpherson2.com](http://willmcpherson2.com). The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/willmcpherson2/blog)

My current project is called [Tulip](https://github.com/willmcpherson2/tulip). It's a tiny Lisp.

The parser for Tulip uses my own parsing library called [Parss](https://github.com/willmcpherson2/parss).

All three projects are written in Haskell :-)

### Job

I currently work at RMIT's AI Innovation Lab.
